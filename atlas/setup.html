      <h3>Why use MongoDB Atlas?</h3>

      <p>
        MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-hosted service that provides fully managed MongoDB databases. It allows you to scale your database easily, manage it from anywhere, and provides built-in security features to protect your data.
      </p>

      <h3>Getting started with MongoDB Atlas</h3>
      <p>
        To get started with MongoDB Atlas, you'll need to sign up for an account. Head to the MongoDB Atlas website and click the "Sign Up" button in the top-right corner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you've signed up, you'll need to create a new project. A project is a way to organize your MongoDB databases, users, and other resources. Click the "Create a New Project" button and give your project a name.
      </p>

      <h3>Creating a MongoDB database</h3>
      <p>
        After creating a project, you'll need to create a MongoDB database. Click the "Build a New Cluster" button, choose a cloud provider and region, and select a cluster tier. You can choose a free tier to get started.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the cluster is created, you'll see a "Connect" button. Click it and select "Connect Your Application". This will provide you with a connection string that you can use to connect to your MongoDB database from your application.
      </p>

      <h3>Add users who can access your MongoDB database</h3>
      <p>
        You can also add users to your database by clicking the "Database Access" tab and then clicking the "Add New User" button. Give your user a name and password, and specify the database(s) they should have access to.
      </p>

      <h3>How to create a database in MongoDB database</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Log in to your MongoDB Atlas account and go to the
          &quot;Clusters&quot; section.
        </li>
        <li>Select the cluster you want to create the database in.</li>
        <li>
          Click on the &quot;Collections&quot; button in the left-hand menu.
        </li>
        <li>Click on the &quot;Create Database&quot; button.</li>
        <li>Enter a name for your new database.</li>
        <li>Click the &quot;Create&quot; button to create the new database.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Once you've created a collection, you can add data to it by clicking the "Insert Document" button. This will open up a JSON editor where you can enter your data.
      </p>
      <h3>Doing CRUD operations on the data</h3>
      <p>
        CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic functions of persistent storage. MongoDB provides several methods to perform CRUD operations on the data stored in the database.
      </p>
